# High-Level Overview and User Manual

## Project Overview

This project provides a software framework for interfacing with hardware platforms using the PlatformIO ecosystem. It is configured for the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller and leverages the Arduino framework for ease of development and compatibility with a wide range of libraries.

### Key Components

- **Hardware:** Configured for the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller.
- **Platform:** PlatformIO IDE, offering a modern development environment and integration.
- **Functionality:** Reads analog values from a Hall sensor and communicates the data via Serial.

```

### Core Features

1. **LED Indicator:**
   - Blinks the built-in LED during the setup phase until the Serial connection is established.
2. **Sensor Integration:**
   - Reads data from a Hall sensor connected to pin 14.
   - Outputs sensor data via the Serial interface.

## User Manual

### Prerequisites

1. Install [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/).
2. Set up the Teensyduino add-on for Teensy board compatibility.
3. Connect a Hall sensor to the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller (pin 14).

### Setup and Configuration

#### PlatformIO Configuration File (`platformio.ini`)

```ini
[env:teensy41]
platform = teensy
board = teensy41
framework = arduino
```

This file configures the project for the Teensy 4.1 board, using the Arduino framework. Additional libraries or settings can be added to this file as required.

#### Source Code (`src/main.cpp`)

This file contains the primary logic:
- Configures the LED (pin 13) and Hall sensor (pin 14).
- Reads analog values from the Hall sensor in the loop.
- Outputs the sensor data via Serial for monitoring or further processing.

### Build and Upload

1. Connect the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller to your computer via USB.
2. Open the project in PlatformIO.
3. Build the project by clicking the “Build” button in PlatformIO or running the following command:
   ```
   platformio run
   ```
4. Upload the firmware to the Teensy board by clicking the “Upload” button or running:
   ```
   platformio run --target upload
   ```

### Running the Program

1. Open a Serial Monitor (available in PlatformIO or any terminal tool supporting serial communication) at 9600 baud.
2. Observe the Hall sensor’s analog readings being printed to the Serial Monitor.
3. Verify the built-in LED stops blinking once the Serial connection is established.

### Customization

- **Adding Functionality:**
  - Add header files under the `include` directory.
  - Add additional libraries under the `lib` directory.

- **Adjusting Pins:**
  Modify the `LED_PIN` and `HALL_SENSOR` definitions in `main.cpp` to match your hardware setup.

### Troubleshooting

- **Serial Not Responding:**
  Ensure the correct COM port is selected in your Serial Monitor.
- **No LED Blinking:**
  Verify the Teensy is powered and properly connected to your computer.
